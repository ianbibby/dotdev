I am currently a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Dell, living in sunny California, USA. I have been programming professionally since 2004 with the last 5 years spent building large scale distributed storage services in Go. An occasional blogger on a variety of software related topics, I am most passionate about the ideals of Software Craftsmanship and always enjoy a good debate about Software Engineering, Continuous Delivery, Testing, or Clean Coding.
